FinalCif recent changes
-----------------------

       https://www.iucr.org/resources/cif/spec/version1.1/cifsyntax Point 33
* v149 Minor bugfix for syntax check of included SHELXL file.

* v142 Added new option to make a report with picometers instead of angstroms for all distances. The default report
       was moved to a template and the hard-coded report was discarded (only important for programmers).
       Saving/loading of options fixed. Improved documentation.
* v141 Added feature to delete the currently selected block of a multi-CIF by right-click on the dropbox.

* v138 Validators for loop values were added. Incorrect loop values turn the input field red and changed values are gray now.
       Faster loading of large CIF files. The warning about inconsistent temperatures from different files was improved.
       Empty loop values could not be overwritten by a dot. This has been fixed. Loops in the saved CIF are now aligned.

       when Checkcif is finished. Fixed behavior of FinalCif when run from within ShelXle. The commandline arguments
       are now handled correctly.

       templates list which makes them easier to change. Updated documentation. And other small changes.
* v123 Added checkbox to import only new items from a CIF.

       only the half sentence "from xx at y or similar". Small improvements were made in the report text wording.
       Fields with dropdown menus can now also be used in combination with large text templates. Improved line wrapping
       of longer text, so that space characters don't vanish anymore.
