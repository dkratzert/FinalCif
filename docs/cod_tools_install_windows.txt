How to run cif_cod_check in Windows
-----------------------------------

These are rough instructions for cif_cod_check from the COD tools
to run on Windows. Have to do this in an automated script...

* install strawberry perl
* install perl packages:
  - Parse::Yapp
  - DateTime::Format::RFC3339
  - Date::Calc
  - Data::Compare
* Compile parser:
  yapp -m COD::CIF::Parser::Yapp  Yapp.yp
* How about spglib Perl binding?

* Comment out line 49 in cif_cod_check
* Comment out 71-87 so that parser is yapp version only
* Make version in line 26 of Yapp.pm work
