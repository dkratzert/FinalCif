FinalCif
=========

Finalcif is mainly intended for Bruker users, but works for other CIF files too. It collects all the information from a
work folder needed in order to finalize a CIF file for publication.
In ideal cases, it takes one click to have a publication-ready file. But check the file thoroughly afterwards,
no software is perfect!
