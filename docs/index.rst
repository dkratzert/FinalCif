Usually, CIF files need some extra tedious work to get them ready for publication.
Finalcif tries to collects all the information from a work folder needed in order
to finalize a CIF file for publication. But also information that is not at hand automatically
can be filled in conveniently.
In ideal cases, it takes one click to have a publication-ready file. But check the file
thoroughly afterwards, no software is perfect!
