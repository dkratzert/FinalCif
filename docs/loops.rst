Loops
=====

FinalCif is also able to edit loop data from a CIf file by clicking the "Edit Loops" button. 
Each loop has its own tab where the loop data is represented as a table. All fields changed by the user
will turn pale red to indicate modifications and these are save during the next file save.

Rows can be added and deleted with a right click on a table.

The "revert changes" button reverts all changes done to the current loop, except for adding and deleting rows.

The "Manuscript Related" tab contains an input mask to add author information for publication purpose as a cif loop.
This is not to be confused with the "Crystallographer Details" in the "Equipment and Author Templates" section.
New authors can be saved as templates for future use.
