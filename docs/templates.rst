Templates
=========

FinalCif uses two different kinds of templates to to simplify recurring tasks:

* Equipment and Author templates
    They are useful for definitions of parameters like the properties of a measurement device
    or the name and address of the crystallographer. Apply template by double-clicking on one row.
* Property templates
    Property templates define possible dropdown-menus for common CIF keywords like _cell_measurement_temperature.
    The template values are accessible as a dropdown behind the respective key in the main table of FinalCif.

The templates selection and editor.

You can anytime edit one of the templates and save them. You can use them for any cif keyword. 
Just be creative...

Or just one keyword for only the absolute configuration information:
